## Celebrity Death Analytics: Whitney Houston and Angie Stone's Death Speculations

### Overview

This repository presents a data analytics study examining the death of Whitney Houston (February 11, 2012) through six speculative scenarios, ranging from low-probability rumors to high-probability evidence-based theories. Using RStudio and the `plotly` library, this project builds on a prior analysis of Angie Stone’s death (March 1, 2025) to explore patterns in celebrity death conspiracies as of March 26, 2025. The study leverages mock datasets and predictive modeling to estimate the likelihood of each scenario, visualized in an interactive 3D scatter plot.

### What Was Accomplished

#### Whitney Houston Death Scenarios
- **Objective**: Analyzed six top-probability scenarios for Whitney Houston’s death, inspired by official reports, media, X rumors, and parallels to Angie Stone’s case.
- **Scenarios**:
  - **Low-Probability** (Rumor-Driven):
    - Drug Dealer Murder (6.7%): Killed over a $1.5M debt, staged drowning.
    - Clive Davis Conspiracy (2.6%): Mentor orchestrated death for profit or silence.
    - Bobby Brown Involvement (4.2%): Ex-husband arranged death.
  - **High-Probability** (Evidence-Based):
    - Accidental Overdose and Drowning (45.0%): Official coroner finding.
    - Prescription Drug Interaction (30.8%): Cocaine, Xanax, alcohol mix caused drowning.
    - Industry Hit via Sabotage (37.3%): Industry sabotaged her with drugs, tied to disputes.
- **Methodology**: Used a predictive model: Adjusted Likelihood = Initial_Likelihood × (Evidence_Strength + Motive_Plausibility) / (1 + Rumor_Spread). Inputs derived from coroner reports, X sentiment, and hypothetical evidence.
- **Output**: A 3D scatter plot visualizing likelihood, evidence strength, and rumor spread, with hover details for each scenario.

#### Angie Stone Death Crash Scenarios

- **Objective**: Analyzed six top-probability scenarios related to Angie Stone's car crash, with a focus on potential foul play, mechanical sabotage, and negligence.
- **Scenarios**:
  - **Low-Probability** (Rumor-Driven):
    - Insurance Scam (3.8%): Staged crash for financial gain.
    - Woman Pushed Her (0.8%): Another person pushed Stone.
    - Unalived Before Crash (7.1%): Stone was already dead before the crash.
  - **High-Probability** (Evidence-Based):
    - Driver Negligence with Intent (57.7%): Reckless driving or intentional crash.
    - Mechanical Sabotage (63.8%): Sabotage of the van due to industry disputes.
    - Targeted Truck Collision (45.7%): Collision caused by a truck driver with personal connections.
- **Methodology**: Similar to Houston’s case, the adjusted likelihood is calculated based on evidence strength, rumor spread, and probability adjustments.

### Findings: Angie Stone’s Death Scenarios

- **Driver Negligence with Intent** (57.7%) leads, suggesting reckless or intentional driving.
- **Mechanical Sabotage** (63.8%) highlights the possibility of tampering tied to industry disputes, indicating foul play.
- **Low-Probability** rumors (0.8-7.1%) are speculative and lack strong supporting evidence.

### Conclusion

This project delivers a structured analysis of

 Whitney Houston and Angie Stone’s deaths, balancing official narratives with high-profile rumors. The 3D visualization highlights “Accidental Overdose” and “Mechanical Sabotage” as the most plausible scenarios, while keeping the possibility of industry-related conspiracy theories in mind. Contributions to refine probabilities or expand to other cases (e.g., Prince) are welcome!
